# Signature verification bypass
Bypasses the requirement for your callback to be in a signed driver.
# Usage
Include these 3 headers and use the `register_unsigned_callbacks` function when registering unsigned callbacks. The function is pretty much the same as `ObRegisterCallbacks`.
# Note
This works on `Windows 10 19045.5011`. I haven't tested it yet on Windows 11.

### Dec. 22th
This repository is pending to be rewritten due to its lack of information on the actual bypass. I am very sorry for this. I couldn't provide any more information on how this actually works because, basically, I'm lazy. I finished this project
months ago but didn't update my journal, so I had to manually document everything I did. Obviously, I barely remembered what I did, and both my IDA database and VM were gone since this is very old. \
To wrap things up, I'll try to find some time one of these days to document this properly.
