# Signature verification bypass
Read the code. I'm not explaining how it works.
# Usage
Include these 3 files and run `register_unsigned_callbacks`. The function is pretty much the same as `ObRegisterCallbacks`.
# Note
This works on `Windows 10 19045.5011`. I haven't tested it yet on Windows 11.

Why is this so poorly written?

Bc the whole project this bypass was a part of ended up being completely useless, I'm fucking frustrated at this point. Expect better documentation in the future.
